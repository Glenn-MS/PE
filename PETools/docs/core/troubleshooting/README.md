# Core Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides troubleshooting tips for common issues encountered while using the Core layer in the PETools platform.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Interface Implementation Errors

**Symptoms**:
- Errors during runtime indicating missing method implementations.
- Compilation errors related to interface contracts.

**Possible Causes**:
- A class implementing an interface is missing required methods.
- Method signatures do not match the interface definition.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure all methods defined in the interface are implemented.
- Verify that method signatures match the interface definition.

### 2. Dependency Injection Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Errors during application startup related to missing service registrations.
- Null reference exceptions when accessing injected services.

**Possible Causes**:
- Required services are not registered in the dependency injection container.
- Incorrect service lifetimes (e.g., singleton vs transient).

**Solutions**:
- Register all required services in the `Startup` class or equivalent.
- Use appropriate lifetimes for services based on their usage.

### 3. Model Serialization Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Errors during JSON serialization or deserialization.
- Missing or incorrect data in serialized output.

**Possible Causes**:
- Models are missing required properties or attributes.
- Circular references in model relationships.

**Solutions**:
- Add required properties and attributes (e.g., `[JsonProperty]`).
- Use serialization settings to handle circular references.

### 4. Performance Bottlenecks

**Symptoms**:
- Slow execution of Core utilities or services.
- High CPU or memory usage during Core operations.

**Possible Causes**:
- Inefficient algorithms or redundant computations.
- Excessive logging or unnecessary operations.

**Solutions**:
- Optimize algorithms and remove redundant computations.
- Review and minimize logging in performance-critical paths.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   - Set the logging level to `Debug` to capture detailed logs.

2. **Use Breakpoints**:
   - Use breakpoints in your IDE to trace the execution flow of Core components.

3. **Test in Isolation**:
   - Test individual components (e.g., interfaces, models) in isolation to identify issues.

4. **Monitor Resource Usage**:
   - Use tools like Visual Studio Profiler to track CPU and memory usage.

## Contact Support

If the issue persists, contact the support team with the following information:

1. Detailed description of the issue.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue.
3. Relevant logs and error messages.
4. Configuration file (if applicable).
