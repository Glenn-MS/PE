# Core Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for developing, maintaining, and using the Core layer in the PETools platform.

## General Guidelines

1. **Follow Interface Contracts**:
   - Ensure all providers and services implement the required interfaces.
   - Use meaningful names for methods and parameters.

2. **Use Dependency Injection**:
   - Inject dependencies into Core components for better testability.
   - Avoid hardcoding dependencies.

3. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for all Core components to ensure reliability.
   - Use mocking frameworks to simulate external dependencies.

4. **Document Interfaces**:
   - Provide clear documentation for all interfaces to guide implementers.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Optimize Algorithms**:
   - Use efficient algorithms for common operations.
   - Avoid unnecessary loops and redundant calculations.

2. **Minimize Overhead**:
   - Keep models and utilities lightweight.
   - Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Validate Inputs**:
   - Use validation utilities to enforce input security.
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

2. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Store sensitive data in Azure Key Vault or similar services.
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets in the codebase.

## Testing and Monitoring

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for interfaces, models, and utilities.
   - Use integration tests to validate interactions between components.

2. **Logging**:
   - Use standardized logging utilities for consistent log messages.
   - Log key events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
