# Infrastructure Layer Documentation

The Infrastructure layer in PETools is responsible for provider orchestration and serves as a factory for creating appropriate provider instances. It bridges the Core business logic with specific provider implementations, following .NET 10 clean architecture principles.

## Purpose

Infrastructure implements the interfaces defined in the Core layer and acts as the coordination layer between abstract business requirements and concrete provider implementations. Its main responsibilities include:

- **Provider Factory**: Creating the appropriate provider instance based on context
- **Orchestration**: Managing the interaction between different provider implementations
- **External System Integration**: Connecting Core business logic with provider-specific functionality

## Key Components

- **ProviderFactory**: Dynamically creates providers based on request context
- **Provider Orchestration**: Coordinates operations across multiple providers
- **Configuration Management**: Handles provider-specific configuration settings

## Integration Points

- **Core**: Implements interfaces defined in Core (dependency inversion)
- **Provider Projects**: References and instantiates specific provider implementations
- **API**: Indirectly utilized by API through Core abstractions

## Provider Structure

The Infrastructure layer works with separate provider implementation projects:

- **AzureProvider**: Azure-specific functionality and integration
- **GitHubProvider**: GitHub-specific functionality and integration
- **AzureDevOpsProvider**: Azure DevOps-specific functionality and integration
