# Infrastructure Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides troubleshooting tips for common issues encountered while using the Infrastructure layer in the PETools platform.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Deployment Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Deployment operations fail with error messages.
- Resources are not created or updated as expected.

**Possible Causes**:
- Errors in the infrastructure template.
- Missing or incorrect parameters.

**Solutions**:
- Validate the template using `bicep build` or `bicep linter`.
- Ensure all required parameters are provided and correctly formatted.
- Check the deployment logs for detailed error messages.

### 2. Resource Access Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Resources are inaccessible after deployment.
- Network-related errors when connecting to resources.

**Possible Causes**:
- Misconfigured network security settings.
- Missing private endpoints or NSG rules.

**Solutions**:
- Verify network security group (NSG) rules and private endpoint configurations.
- Use Azure Network Watcher to diagnose connectivity issues.

### 3. Provider Errors

**Symptoms**:
- Operations fail with provider-specific error messages.
- Logs indicate issues with provider initialization or execution.

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect provider configuration.
- Missing dependencies or credentials.

**Solutions**:
- Verify provider settings in the configuration file.
- Ensure all required dependencies and credentials are available.

### 4. Performance Bottlenecks

**Symptoms**:
- Slow deployment times.
- High resource utilization during operations.

**Possible Causes**:
- Large or complex templates.
- Inefficient resource allocation.

**Solutions**:
- Break down large templates into smaller modules.
- Optimize resource allocation and use incremental deployments.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   - Set the logging level to `Debug` to capture detailed logs.

2. **Use Azure Portal**:
   - Check the deployment status and logs in the Azure Portal.

3. **Test in Isolation**:
   - Test individual templates or modules to identify issues.

4. **Monitor Resource Usage**:
   - Use Azure Monitor to track resource utilization and identify bottlenecks.
