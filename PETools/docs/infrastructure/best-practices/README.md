# Infrastructure Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for developing, maintaining, and using the Infrastructure layer in the PETools platform.

## General Guidelines

1. **Use Modular Templates**:
   - Break down large infrastructure templates into smaller, reusable modules.
   - Use Azure Verified Modules (AVM) for standardized deployments.

2. **Follow Naming Conventions**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for resources to improve readability and management.

3. **Automate Deployments**:
   - Use CI/CD pipelines to automate infrastructure deployments.
   - Validate templates before deployment using tools like `bicep build`.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Optimize Resource Allocation**:
   - Use appropriate SKUs for resources based on workload requirements.
   - Scale resources dynamically to handle varying workloads.

2. **Minimize Deployment Time**:
   - Deploy resources in parallel where possible.
   - Use incremental deployments to reduce downtime.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secure Secrets**:
   - Store sensitive data in Azure Key Vault.
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets in templates or code.

2. **Enforce RBAC**:
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources.
   - Assign roles at the appropriate scope (e.g., subscription, resource group).

3. **Enable Network Security**:
   - Use private endpoints to secure resource access.
   - Configure network security groups (NSGs) to control traffic.

## Testing and Monitoring

1. **Validate Templates**:
   - Use tools like `bicep linter` to validate templates for errors and best practices.

2. **Monitor Deployments**:
   - Use Azure Monitor to track deployment status and resource health.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues.

3. **Log Key Events**:
   - Enable diagnostic logging for all resources.
   - Use centralized logging solutions like Azure Log Analytics.
