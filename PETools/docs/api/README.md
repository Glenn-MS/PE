# API Layer Documentation

The API layer in PETools exposes RESTful endpoints that provide access to the platform's core functionality. It serves as the primary interface for client applications and extensions to interact with the platform services.

## Purpose

The API layer acts as the gateway to PETools functionality, providing:

- **HTTP Interface**: RESTful endpoints for client applications and extensions
- **Request/Response Handling**: Processing incoming requests and returning appropriate responses
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Security for API endpoints
- **Data Transformation**: Converting between API models and Core domain models

## Key Components

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and delegate to Core services (e.g., AIController)
- **Middleware**: Process requests for cross-cutting concerns like logging and security
- **API Models**: DTOs for API request/response contracts
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation and exploration

## Integration Points

- **Core**: Depends on Core for business logic and domain models
- **AI**: May leverage AI services for intelligent API features 
- **Extensions**: Consumed by VS Code and Visual Studio extensions

## Architecture Benefits

- **Clean Separation**: API concerns are separated from business logic
- **Versioning Support**: API versioning without affecting Core functionality
- **Independent Scaling**: API layer can be scaled independently
- **Client Abstraction**: Shields clients from internal implementation details
