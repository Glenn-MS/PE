# API Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for developing, maintaining, and using the API layer in the PETools platform.

## General Guidelines

1. **Secure Endpoints**:
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications.
   - Implement authentication and authorization for sensitive operations.

2. **Validate Inputs**:
   - Validate all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks.
   - Use data annotations and middleware for input validation.

3. **Use Dependency Injection**:
   - Inject dependencies into controllers for better testability and maintainability.

4. **Log Key Events**:
   - Log all API requests and responses for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Optimize API Routes**:
   - Use meaningful and concise route names.
   - Avoid deeply nested routes.

2. **Implement Caching**:
   - Cache frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
   - Use distributed caching for scalability.

3. **Minimize Payloads**:
   - Return only the necessary data in API responses.
   - Use pagination for large datasets.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication**:
   - Use Azure AD for secure authentication.
   - Implement token-based authentication for API access.

2. **Authorization**:
   - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for all endpoints.
   - Use policies to define access rules.

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Use Azure Key Vault for secure storage of secrets.

## Testing and Monitoring

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for controllers and middleware.
   - Use integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Use Azure Monitor to track API performance and errors.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain up-to-date API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
