# API Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides troubleshooting tips for common issues encountered while using the API layer in the PETools platform.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Authentication Errors

**Symptoms**:
- API requests fail with `401 Unauthorized` errors.
- Logs show errors related to token validation.

**Possible Causes**:
- Missing or expired authentication tokens.
- Incorrect Azure AD configuration.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the token in the request header.
- Check Azure AD settings in `appsettings.json`.
- Ensure the client application is registered in Azure AD.

### 2. API Communication Failures

**Symptoms**:
- API requests fail with timeout or connection errors.
- Logs show errors related to network connectivity.

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect API endpoint URL.
- Network issues or firewall restrictions.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the API endpoint URL.
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings.
- Use tools like `curl` or Postman to test API accessibility.

### 3. Unexpected API Responses

**Symptoms**:
- API responses contain unexpected or incorrect data.
- Logs show errors related to data processing.

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect input parameters.
- Bugs in the API logic.

**Solutions**:
- Validate input parameters before making API requests.
- Debug the API logic to identify and fix bugs.
- Add unit tests to cover edge cases.

### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:
- API operations take longer than expected to complete.
- High CPU or memory usage during API tasks.

**Possible Causes**:
- Inefficient algorithms or resource-intensive tasks.
- Insufficient system resources.

**Solutions**:
- Optimize algorithms and reduce redundant computations.
- Scale system resources dynamically based on workload.
- Use asynchronous programming to parallelize tasks.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   - Set the logging level to `Debug` in the configuration file to capture detailed logs.

2. **Use Breakpoints**:
   - Use breakpoints in your IDE to trace the execution flow of API operations.

3. **Test in Isolation**:
   - Test individual endpoints in isolation to identify issues.

4. **Monitor Resource Usage**:
   - Use tools like Azure Monitor to track CPU, memory, and network usage.

## Contact Support

If the issue persists, contact the support team with the following information:

1. Detailed description of the issue.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue.
3. Relevant logs and error messages.
4. Configuration file (e.g., `appsettings.json`).
