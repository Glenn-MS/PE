# Architecture Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides troubleshooting tips for common architectural challenges in the Platform Engineering Tools (PETools) platform.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Scalability Issues

**Symptoms**:
- The platform cannot handle increased workloads.
- High latency or timeouts during peak usage.

**Possible Causes**:
- Insufficient resource allocation.
- Lack of auto-scaling configurations.

**Solutions**:
- Enable auto-scaling for Azure App Service and Container Apps.
- Monitor resource usage and adjust configurations as needed.

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities

**Symptoms**:
- Unauthorized access to resources.
- Data breaches or exposed secrets.

**Possible Causes**:
- Misconfigured RBAC or network security policies.
- Hardcoded secrets in code or templates.

**Solutions**:
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management.
- Enforce RBAC and review network security policies.

### 3. Deployment Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Errors during infrastructure or application deployment.
- Inconsistent environments after deployment.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid Bicep templates or parameters.
- Missing dependencies or misconfigured pipelines.

**Solutions**:
- Validate Bicep templates using `bicep build`.
- Check pipeline configurations and ensure all dependencies are installed.

### 4. Performance Bottlenecks

**Symptoms**:
- Slow response times for API requests.
- High CPU or memory usage during operations.

**Possible Causes**:
- Inefficient algorithms or resource-intensive tasks.
- Lack of caching or asynchronous processing.

**Solutions**:
- Optimize algorithms and implement caching.
- Use asynchronous programming to parallelize tasks.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   - Set the logging level to `Debug` to capture detailed logs.

2. **Use Azure Monitor**:
   - Track resource usage and application performance.

3. **Test in Isolation**:
   - Test individual components to identify bottlenecks or issues.

4. **Review Deployment Logs**:
   - Check deployment logs for errors or warnings.
