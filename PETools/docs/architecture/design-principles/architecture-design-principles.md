# Architecture Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles that guide the architecture of the Platform Engineering Tools (PETools) platform.

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity**:
   - Each component is designed to be self-contained and independently deployable.
   - Promotes reusability and simplifies maintenance.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Distinct layers handle specific responsibilities (e.g., API, Core, Infrastructure).
   - Reduces coupling and improves code clarity.

3. **Scalability**:
   - The architecture supports horizontal and vertical scaling to handle varying workloads.
   - Uses Azure services like App Service and Container Apps for scalability.

4. **Security**:
   - Implements Azure AD for authentication and RBAC for authorization.
   - Ensures secure communication between components using HTTPS.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Designed to accommodate new features and integrations with minimal changes.
   - Uses a provider pattern for cloud service integrations.

6. **Resilience**:
   - Incorporates redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
   - Uses Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for proactive issue detection.

7. **Performance Efficiency**:
   - Optimized for minimal latency and efficient resource utilization.
   - Implements caching and asynchronous processing where applicable.
