# Architecture Best Practices

This document provides best practices for maintaining and evolving the architecture of the Platform Engineering Tools (PETools) platform.

## General Guidelines

1. **Adopt Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**:
   - Follow WAF pillars: reliability, security, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and operational excellence.

2. **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Define infrastructure using Bicep templates and Azure Verified Modules (AVM).
   - Automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines.

3. **Implement Observability**:
   - Use Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for centralized logging and monitoring.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues.

4. **Optimize Resource Utilization**:
   - Use auto-scaling and reserved instances to manage costs.
   - Monitor resource usage and adjust configurations as needed.

5. **Secure the Architecture**:
   - Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management.
   - Enforce RBAC and network security policies.

6. **Promote Modularity**:
   - Design components to be self-contained and reusable.
   - Use interfaces and abstractions to decouple dependencies.

7. **Document the Architecture**:
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation for all components and layers.
   - Use diagrams to visualize system interactions.
