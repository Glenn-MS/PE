# AI Layer - Components

This document provides an overview of the components that make up the AI layer in the PETools platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Semantic Kernel Integration

The Semantic Kernel is a flexible framework for AI operations, enabling:

- Natural language understanding
- Contextual reasoning
- Task planning and execution

#### Features

- **Plugins**: Extendable with custom plugins for specific tasks.
- **Memory**: Stores contextual information for better decision-making.
- **Connectors**: Integrates with external APIs and services.

### 2. AutoGen Integration

AutoGen provides an alternative approach to AI operations, focusing on:

- Automated code generation
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Specialized AI tasks

#### Features

- **Code Generation**: Generates code snippets and templates.
- **Agent Collaboration**: Coordinates multiple AI agents for complex tasks.
- **Custom Models**: Supports integration with custom AI models.

### 3. Agent Mode

Agent Mode is the primary operation mode of the AI layer, leveraging Semantic Kernel for:

- Contextual understanding
- Decision-making
- Task execution

#### Example Workflow

1. Receive a natural language query.
2. Parse the query using Semantic Kernel.
3. Execute the task and return the result.

### 4. Alternative Agent Mode

This mode uses AutoGen for:

- Specialized AI tasks
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Automated workflows

#### Example Workflow

1. Define a task plan.
2. Assign tasks to individual agents.
3. Aggregate results and return the output.

### 5. API Integration

The AI layer is integrated with the PETools API, exposing its capabilities to external systems. Key endpoints include:

- `/api/ai/execute`: Executes an AI operation.
- `/api/ai/status`: Retrieves the status of an AI task.

### 6. Plugin System

The plugin system allows developers to extend the AI layer with custom functionality. Plugins can be dynamically loaded and used for:

- Domain-specific tasks
- Custom data processing
- Integration with third-party services

#### Example Plugin

```csharp
public class CustomPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public string Name => "CustomPlugin";

    public async Task<object> ExecuteAsync(string operationName, object parameters)
    {
        if (operationName == "CustomTask")
        {
            // Implement custom task logic
            return new { Success = true, Message = "Task completed." };
        }

        throw new NotSupportedException($"Operation {operationName} is not supported.");
    }
}
```
